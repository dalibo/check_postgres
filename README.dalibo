This is the custom dalibo branch.

Since there are some pacthes, signatures are out of date.
Thus, checking them will lead to failure.

Patches:
  - Fix query_time action for PostgreSQL < 8.3
  - Add hot_standby_delay action
  - Order result by freshness of operation when using perflimit in
    check_last_vacuum_analyze instead of relation name
