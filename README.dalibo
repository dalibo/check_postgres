This is the unofficial custom dalibo branch.

Since there are some pacthes, signatures are out of date.
Thus, checking them will lead to failure.

Patches:
  - Fix query_time action for PostgreSQL < 8.3
  - Order result by freshness of operation when using perflimit in
    check_last_vacuum_analyze instead of relation name

Disclaimer: this is not a fork of the check_postgres project. Patches come
  without any warranty.
